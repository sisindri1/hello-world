BSOD -Blue screen of dead error in windows:

1.Blue screens are generally caused by problems with your computer’s hardware or issues with its hardware driver software.
 Sometimes, they can be caused by issues with low-level software running in the Windows kernel. Regular apps usually won’t
 be able to cause blue screens.
2.When a blue screen occurs, Windows automatically creates a “minidump” file that contains information about the crash and
 saves it to your disk. You can view information about these minidumps to help identify the cause of the blue screen. 
3.This information is also available in the Windows Event Viewer, where blue screen messages are scattered among application crashes and other system log messages.
